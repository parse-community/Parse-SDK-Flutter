## Compatibility

The Parse Dart SDK is continuously tested with the most recent release of the Dart framework to ensure compatibility. To give developers time to upgrade their app to a newer Dart framework, previous Dart framework releases are supported for at least 1 year after the [release date](https://dart.dev/get-dart/archive) of the next higher significant version.
