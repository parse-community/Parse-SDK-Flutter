## Compatibility

The Parse Flutter SDK is continuously tested with the most recent release of the Flutter framework to ensure compatibility. To give developers time to upgrade their app to a newer Flutter framework, previous Flutter framework releases are supported for at least 1 year after the [release date](https://docs.flutter.dev/release/archive?tab=linux) of the next higher significant version. The Parse Flutter SDK depends on the Parse Dart SDK which may require a higher Dart framework version than the Flutter framework version, in which case the specific Flutter framework version cannot be supported.

| Version      | Latest Version | End of Support | Compatible |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|------------|
| Flutter 3.16 | 3.16.9         | Jan 2025       | ✅ Yes      |
| Flutter 3.19 | 3.19.6         | Apr 2025       | ✅ Yes      |
| Flutter 3.22 | 3.22.3         | Jul 2025       | ✅ Yes      |
| Flutter 3.24 | 3.24.3         | Sep 2025       | ✅ Yes      |
