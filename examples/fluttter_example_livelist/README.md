# ParesLiveList example
Change application_constants.dart and give it a try.

You need a class "Test" with the fields <String> text, <Boolean> show and <Number> order in your database.
You have to add some data by yourself. (The app is TO simple)
(The class should be Read/Write for public)

It's recommended to use the Parse Dashboard to manipulate the data.
This way, you will be able to hide objects and edit items, while your device is offline.
